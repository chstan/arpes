# Containerized versions of PyARPES

Most users should install according to the directions in the documentation. This means using a source install (git followed by editable install with pip) or should install directly from a package manager. It is useful for CI/CD and in cases where installations are to be set up automatically to use containers, however.

If you want to add a container format, put relevant documentation about the build process and any build metadata into a subfolder here.
